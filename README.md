# Genshin-Impact-Wish-Statistics
This program calculates your chances when wishing in Genshin Impact.

How to use: just paste the Genshin wish system.py file into your favorite python compiler and hit 'Run'.

Some important notes before you get started:
1. If you want to see a plot of your chances, make sure you have a Python compiler that has the matplotlib module and that it can display plots.
   Not all compilers have this or can do this. Personally, I use Spyder for running this program. You can download Spyder for free.
   However, if you don't want to download anything, I recommend using [codabrainy.com](https://www.codabrainy.com/en/python-compiler/).
   Note when you use codabrainy: After you make a graph, you have to stop the program and run it again if you want to do another calculation.
3. The bigger the number of wishes you want to know your chances for, the longer the program takes.
   On my laptop, which is quite fast, it takes about 10 seconds to calculate the odds for 900 wishes.
   On online compilers, it can take way longer.
4. The program also takes longer the higher constellations/refinements you want to calculate.
5. The program also takes (much) longer if you want to make a graph of your chances.
