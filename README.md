# Genshin-Impact-Wish-Statistics
This program calculates your chances when wishing in Genshin Impact

Some important notes before you get started:
1. If you want to see a plot of your chances, make sure you have a Python compiler that has the matplotlib module and that it can display plots.
   Not all compilers have this or can do this. Personally, I use Spyder for running this program. You can download Spyder for free.
   However, if you don't want to download anything, I recommend using [codabrainy.com](https://www.codabrainy.com/en/python-compiler/).
3. The bigger the number of wishes you want to know your chances for, the longer the program takes.
   On my laptop, which is quite fast, it takes about 10 seconds to calculate the odds for 900 wishes.
   On online compilers, it can take way longer.
4. The program also takes longer the higher constellations/refinements you want to calculate.
